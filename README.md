## Local development

`$ git clone https://github.com/dotfold/dotvimstat.git`

dotvimstat uses Ant as the build system.

Once the repository is cloned successfully, run:

`$ ant process-sources package-theme`

This sets up the project to be run locally. 

The project is built against Flash Player 10.2, so the playerglobal.swc must be in the SDK path.
